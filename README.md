# JibbleMonitor

Jibble (https://www.jibble.io/) can sometimes **freeze when taking a screenshot**. Occasionally, it recovers on its own, 
but other times it stays stuck, which could cause you to miss screenshots and lead to misunderstandings with your employer.

This small utility **monitors the Jibble log file** to check for recent activity. If **no events are recorded for over 20 minutes**, 
meaning you might have missed one or more screenshots, you will get a **notification in the system tray**. 

Monitoring also **can be paused** if you stop Jibble for a break or at the end of the day by selecting the corresponding option 
from the utility's context menu in the system tray.

You can also turn on **alerts for every new event** in the Jibble log. 
If you see an error like "Connection error saving screenshot" instead of "Image uploaded," you can try restarting Jibble. 
This usually fixes the issue and helps ensure you only lose a single screenshot.
